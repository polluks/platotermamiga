PLATOTerm 0.2 Smoke Test for Amiga Users
========================================

This version is for users with WIFI modems connected to their RS-232
serial port. It uses the default serial.device, for now.

Changes since 0.1
-----------------

There is a new Amiga splash screen, in this version.

The font requirement in the previous release has been removed, as
the required font data is now embedded within the program. Also,
as a result, the installer script is no longer needed, and has
been removed from the 2.x version of the disk.

Note: This is a test release, intended to test whether PLATOTerm works
outside of emulation. The program is still being developed, and many
user interface features are missing. If you can help with finishing
development, please fork the repository on GitHub. Otherwise, please
test, and let us know in the Issues if the terminal adversely does not
at the very least:

Please test
-----------

* Set your baud rate in Serial Preferences (be sure to set RTS/CTS if
you can use it!)
* Set your serial buffer size large enough (e.g. 4000 bytes)
* Start up
* Communicate with your modem (AT OK)
* Connect to IRATA.ONLINE
* Reliably transfer data at the chosen baud rate and buffer settings.
* Properly exit the program.
* Ensure that the Keys and Palette windows in Help work correctly.


Loading PLATOTerm
-----------------
Once installed, PLATOTerm can be accessed simply by clicking on its
icon. The icon is a drawing of a Magnavox PLATO IV terminal, from 1974,
and is widely regarded as the iconic PLATO terminal. If you have a
better icon, please contribute!

Using PLATOTerm
---------------
PLATOTerm will then display a splash screen, indicating that it is
ready for use.

Once you see this splash screen, the terminal is ready for use, and you
can send commands to your WIFI modem, to connect to a PLATO service,
such as IRATA.ONLINE:

ATDTIRATA.ONLINE:8005

or, CYBER1.ORG

ATDTCYBERSERV.ORG:8005

For this initial testing release, the baud rate is set in Preferences.
Be sure to set your baud rate and receive buffer size large enough
(at least 4000 bytes). The menu items for setting these parameters
are still being worked on, and are currently not functional.

Problems?
-----------
This is early test software. If you have problems, please raise an
issue, and I will address them and cut a new release. I am releasing
this early and often so that everyone can test, and we can in the end,
end up with a better piece of software, faster.
