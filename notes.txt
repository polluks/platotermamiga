I had some trouble compiling this under Ubuntu. The default installation
directory is /opt/amiga, so when running 'make all -j3' as a non-root user,
it will fail because it can't access that directory. However, when running
'make all -j3' as root (sudo), suddenly paths such as 'projects/binutils'
became '/projects/binutils', which will fail because it's not  building
in the root directory. In the end, what worked for me was to recursively
change the ownership of /opt/amiga to my own user/group, do a non-root
'make all -j3', and then recursively change the ownership of /opt/amiga back
to root.root.

Notes from Thom:

1. RKM Serial Device reference:

2. Source code example (MicroTerm):

3. There is no need to manhandle the hardware directly, and if you use the OS,
you can leverage better devices (like v34.device and baudbandit.device).

4. Amiga's OS is ridiculously efficient, but its designer made some decisions 
that mean you have to take a slightly more hands-on approach to doing things
like I/O, basically opening message ports, creating I/O requests and sending
them down the line, listening for signals, and then asking for messages that 
come your way.
